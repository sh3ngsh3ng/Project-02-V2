# Introduction
With the advent of technology, education has become more available than ever. Information and knowledge are now literally just one search away. 

<br/>
However, all of these wouldn't have been possible if none of us "share" in the first place. For example, can you imagine a world where no one is answering questions on StackOverFlow? Bizarre, right?

<br
/>
However, not everyone of us 
We are learning and improving 

Various organizations have also contributed to 

For example, various resources such as Khan Academy, Coursera, MIT OpenCourseWare

As such, this project was planned with the intention to add .........

As a tutor myself, 

**QShare** is the short-form derived from Question Sharing. **QShare** provides the convenience for students to find practice questions to get more practice. Furthermore, it allows contributors to add to this pool of question database to share with others.

Let's make educational resources more avaialbe....

# UI/UX
For more details of the planning behind the UI/UX, please refer to: 



<br/>

# Mobile Responsiveness
From the painful experience of Project 1, the strategy for mobile responsiveness this time is to adopt a mobile-first strategy. After the functionality were coded, all the components were styled and adjusted to fit mobile sizing [iPhone X (375px) used as base]. After which, media query was used to adjust the sizing of the elements to fit all the larger resolution devices. 

Below are the devices that can be supported:
- Mobile M (375) to Mobile L (425)
    - iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
    - iPhoneX
- Tablet (768)
    - iPad & iPad Pro
    - Surface Duo
- Laptop (1024)
- Laptop (1440)

# Test Cases
Testing is done using test cases. The focus for testing is to make sure that application allows for the searching, adding, updating and deleting of questions.

Test cases can be found in the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldeXxDb2wLrwYknFTmNlgId-tdx0KqrqBnOrgrWJwvo/edit?usp=sharing

<br/>

# Bugs
Testing is done after every implementation of function/feature. As such, most of the bugs for a particular function/feature is resolved before moving on to the next.

For the bugs encountered during the project, refer to:

Below are some of the unresolved bugs:
- Bug 1
