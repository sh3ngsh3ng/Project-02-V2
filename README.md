# Introduction
The project was designed to further improve the accessibility of educational resources for students undergoing Singapore's education curriculum. In Singapore, bookstores are always filled with assessment books where students can purchase to get more practice questions to practice. However, not everyone have the luxury of getting these books/practice questions. Personally, I **firmly** believe that lack of educational resources should not be an obstacle during the course of learning.
<br />

The next question is, where do we get these resources? When pondering on this question, StackOverFlow came to mind. The place where kind strangers from all around the world share their expertise/knowledge to solve coding issues for others. Can you imagine a world where StackOverFlow is gone? Bizarre, right? With a firm belief and this "sharing/helping culture" notion, **QShare** was conceptualized.
<br />

**QShare** is the short-form derived from Question Sharing. **QShare** provides the platform for students to find practice questions to get more practice. In addition, it allows the users to contribute questions to the database and share them with others!
<br />

# UI/UX (Surface Plane)
The whole theme of the application is to achieve a minimalistic, clean design with a modern style. 

Color:
- A lot of the color chosen for the interface is blue or a family of blue colors due to its association with the theme "Education". For example, "Subject" buttons, Navigation Bar, etc
- Other colors were chosen based on conventionality. E.g. "Submit" buttons are green, "Delete" buttons are red, "Update" buttons are yellowish.

Images:
- Since the application is going for a minimalistic design, not a lot of images were used.
- The landing page uses a "study area" picture to depict convey the purpose of the website.
- A repeating background image is used for the other interface. This repeating image is chosen to give a "texture" to the application. A non-jarring image was used to fit the minimalistic and clean design.

Fonts:
- Font Color: Generally, most of the fonts are black, with the exception where some texts in buttons are white to allow for better visibility. Or
- Font Sizes: Adjustments are made based on the screen sizes to allow for comfortable reading without giving too much of a "chonky text" feels.
- Typography: To fit the theme of mordern and simple, only sans-serif fonts were used instead of serif fonts where decorative lines are present.

# Mobile Responsiveness
From the painful experience of Project 1, the strategy for mobile responsiveness this time is to adopt a mobile-first strategy. After the functionality were coded, all the components were styled and adjusted to fit mobile sizing [iPhone X (375px) used as base]. After which, media query was used to adjust the sizing of the elements to fit all the larger resolution devices. 

Below are the devices that can be supported:
- Mobile M (375) to Mobile L (425)
    - iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
    - iPhoneX
- Tablet (768)
    - iPad & iPad Pro
    - Surface Duo
- Laptop (1024)
- Laptop (1440)

# Test Cases
Testing is done using test cases. The focus for testing is to make sure that application allows for the searching, adding, updating and deleting of questions.

Test cases can be found in the following link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldeXxDb2wLrwYknFTmNlgId-tdx0KqrqBnOrgrWJwvo/edit?usp=sharing

<br/>

# Bugs
Testing is done after every implementation of function/feature. As such, most of the bugs for a particular function/feature is resolved before moving on to the next.
